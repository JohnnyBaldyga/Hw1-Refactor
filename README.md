#HomeWork 1 Refractor

## Description

I changed the div elements into semantic elements for search engine optimization. And to make the readability of the code easier for future coding.

Added Alt tags to the images for accesbility, soo people can see the description of a picture if it is not visible for them.

The heading attributes were put into sequential order to provide search engine optimization, and so whoever is viewing the page has an easier time understanding the content in order

Added a title element for organization when browsing.
